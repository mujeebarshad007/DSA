My name is Niko. I love coding, but DSA makes me question my life choices.  
Everyone says DSA is fun, but sometimes it feels like an endless maze.  
Cool, right? You write one function, and the next day, you forget why you even wrote it.  
But hey, mastering DSA is the ultimate flex in coding world.  
Some people think recursion is magical, others think it's just a cruel trick.  
Anyway, I try, I fail, I debug, and I repeat. Such is the thrilling life of a programmer.
