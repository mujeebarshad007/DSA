                    <h2>Cognitive Processing</h2>
                    <p>The cognitive center, primarily located in the prefrontal
                        cortex, is the brain's executive suite. It's where
                        higher-order thinking happens. This includes logical
                        reasoning, abstract thought, and goal-setting. In tech,
                        this is like the CPU and the main application logic,
                        processing raw data to make intelligent decisions and
                        plan future actions.</p>
                    <p>When you're debugging code, planning a project, or
                        designing a system, you are heavily using this part of
                        your brain. It's the "control" in "control flow."</p>

                <section id="perceptual-details" class="detail-section">
                    <h2>Perceptual Processing</h2>
                    <p>Primarily handled by the occipital lobe, this is the
                        brain's high-powered graphics card. It takes the raw
                        electrical signals from your eyes and interprets them
                        into a rich, 3D model of the world. It processes color,
                        depth, motion, and object recognition in real-time.</p>
                    <p>In technology, this is analogous to computer vision (CV)
                        models, which can identify objects in photos, or the
                        rendering engine of a video game that builds a visual
                        world from data.</p>

                    <h2>Motor Control</h2>
                    <p>The motor cortex is a strip of tissue that acts as the
                        final output controller. It sends signals down the
                        spinal cord to more than 600 muscles, coordinating them
                        with incredible precision. This is what allows you to
                        type, use a mouse, or even just maintain your posture
                        while you work.</p>
                    <p>This system is like the driver or API that sends the
                        final, processed commands to the hardware—telling the
                        printer to print, the robot arm to move, or the screen
                        to display a pixel.</p>

                    <h2>Memory Hub</h2>
                    <p>Involving key structures like the hippocampus and
                        temporal lobe, this is the brain's storage system. It
                        functions as both high-speed RAM (short-term and working
                        memory) and a massive hard drive (long-term memory).
                        It's responsible for encoding new information and
                        retrieving old files when you need them.</p>
                    <p>In tech, this is your database, your file system, and
                        your RAM all working together. Every time you remember a
                        syntax, recall a solution to a bug, or learn a new
                        framework, you are accessing and modifying this powerful
                        system.</p>
